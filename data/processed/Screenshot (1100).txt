i) Test Progress Monitoring,

The purpose of test monitoring is to provide feedback and visibility about test activities. Information
to be monitored may be collected manually or automatically and may be used to measure exit
criteria, such as coverage. Metrics may also be used to assess progress against the planned
schedule and budget. Common test metrics include:
o Percentage of work done in test case preparation (or percentage of planned test cases
prepared)
Percentage of work done in test environment preparation
Test case execution (e.g., number of test cases run/not run, and test cases passed/failed)
Defect information (e.g., defect density, defects found and fixed, failure rate, and re-test results)
Test coverage of requirements, risks or code
Subjective confidence of testers in the product
Dates of test milestones
Testing costs, including the cost compared to the benefit of finding the next defect or to run the
next test
